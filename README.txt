# Gammod
Windows Games Modifier

This is an ambitious project aimed to create some kind of program modifier
It is intended mainly for games, but can be used for anything.

It wants to be a generic wizard-like, task-executor-like program.

I am not a professional developer, this is just as a hobby, spawned out of need to modify
some games and distribute the modifications to my friends so they can apply them as well.

The code is sloppy, ugly, mainly undocumented.

I hope there will be time to make it better :)
