# Gammod
Windows Platform Games Modifier

This is an ambitious project aimed to create some kind of program modifier.
It is intended mainly for games, but can be used for anything.

It wants to be a generic wizard-like, task-executor-like program.
It is based on XML profiles that dictate all the actions to be performed on a program (game).
For example: modify registry, copy/delete/edit files, run external programs, execute special macros build in Gammod.

The XML structure is pretty self explanatory if you look into the XSD schema definition.

I am not a professional developer, this is just as a hobby, spawned out of need to modify
some games and distribute the modifications to my friends so they can apply them as well.

The code is sloppy, ugly, mainly undocumented.
It is build on top of .NET 2.0 framework, so it should be fairly compatible with all modern Windows versions.
Probably in the future will migrate it to 4.0.

The GUI is build on top of MetroFramework

I hope there will be time to make it better :)
